Ensuring that New York constituents are getting an improved overall customer experience through timely and quality service delivery from the call center and city agencies is the heart of NYC311 operation. The Quality Assurance and Training teams, along with other departments within the organization, work together to ensure that every call center employee has the necessary knowledge and abilities to provide excellent customer service to all clients.

In conceptual data modeling, key stakeholders play an important role in defining the requirements and objectives of the system by providing valuable insights and feedback to ensure that the model accurately reflects and supports the business needs and goals and to facilitate collaboration and communication between the system designers and stakeholders.

From the referred resources, several fundamental business concepts were identified to describe and define commonly used terms in quality assurance. Business rules, on the other hand, are guidelines that are based on these business concepts, which establish behavior and decision-making within the organization to achieve its business objectives.

Conceptual data modelling delivers a clear perspective of Quality Assurance department’s structure and how different entities are connected to one another. The use of entity relationship diagram creates a given business rules a better illustration of its outline and process structure, the responsibility of each entity in the organization and the interdependency of different entities to support one another. Using these data modeling tools will help both business users and system developers design database structure based on requirement including development opportunities where the company can focus their resources on to increase the unit’s overall efficiency and productivity.
